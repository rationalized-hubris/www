# Luke Silver

Hi all!

For the past 15+ years, I've been leading engineering teams through the exciting, sometimes chaotic world of technology transformation. I've witnessed firsthand how quickly our industry can pivot, and how those changes ripple through the ways we build products and nurture talent.

My background includes guiding teams through major platform evolutions and helping organizations scale without losing their creative spark. I've had the privilege of seeing how seemingly subtle technical decisions can dramatically improve performance and user engagement, ultimately creating significant business value.

I started this site because I believe we're at another inflection point in our industry. AI isn't just another tool in our kit—it's fundamentally changing what it means to be an engineer. Many of my peers are approaching this shift by applying yesterday's frameworks to tomorrow's challenges. I think there's a different path forward.

My writing comes from a place of genuine curiosity about where we're headed. I don't claim to have all the answers, but I hope sharing my perspectives might help others navigate their own journey through this transformation.

In my leadership roles, I've found that the most innovative work happens in environments where people feel relaxed enough to take creative risks, even while pursuing ambitious goals. I try to bring that same spirit to my writing—thoughtful but approachable, challenging but constructive.

Feel free to reach out with your thoughts. The best ideas often emerge from conversation.
